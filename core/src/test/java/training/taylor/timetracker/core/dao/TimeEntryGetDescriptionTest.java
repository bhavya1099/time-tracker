================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing access control
Issue: The getDescription() method is public and may be accessed from anywhere, potentially exposing sensitive information or allowing for unexpected manipulations.
Solution: Consider implementing access control and restricting visibility of the methods. Using proper access modifiers can greatly boost the security of your Java codes.

Vulnerability: Spring Misconfiguration
Issue: Your import statements suggest that this is a Spring component, but there are no Spring annotations on your class to configure it properly. This could result in unexpected behaviors or data exposures.
Solution: Ensure that your Spring components are configured correctly. Use @Component, @Service, @Repository or @Controller annotations on your class and ensure they're within components that the @ComponentScan can reach.

Vulnerability: Unused imports
Issue: Unused imports like 'import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope' and 'import org.springframework.stereotype.Component' could potentially lead to code confusion, misinterpretation, and unexpected results.
Solution: Remove unused imports from your code to prevent confusion and misinterpretation and maintain the best practice of 'clean code'. Also, it can help in reducing the attack surface of your application.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to check if the getDescription returns the correct default value

  Details:
    TestName: testGetDescriptionDefaultValue
    Description: This test is created to check if the getDescription method is returning the correct default value when no new description is set. The default value of a String in Java is null so we expect this to return null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrange step for this test as we are checking for default behavior.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription method
    Assert: Assert that returned value is null.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the getDefaultDescription method behaves as expected when no value is set. This is necessary to ensure that the expected default behavior of the method is preserved.

  Scenario 2: Test to check if the getDescription method returns the correct value after we set a new description.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetDescriptionNewValue
    Description: This test is created to check if the getDescription method returns the new description after it has been set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set a new description.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
    Assert: Assert that returned value is equal to the new description that we set.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify that the getDescription method returns the accurate description after it has been set. This is critical in ensuring that the method correctly captures modifications to the description.

  Scenario 3: Test to check if the getDescription method returns the last description set.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetDescriptionLastSet
    Description: This test is created to check if the getDescription method returns the most recent description after several modifications. In Java, the last value set to a variable is the one that is held by it.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set multiple new descriptions.
    Act: Invoke the getDescription method.
    Assert: Assert that returned value is equal to the most recent description that was set.
  Validation:
    This test aims to validate that the getDescription method behaves correctly after multiple updates to the description. This checks that the method adheres to the expected principles of how Java stores data in variables.
