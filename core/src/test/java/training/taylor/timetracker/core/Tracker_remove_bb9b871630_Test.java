1. Scenario: TimeEntry Object Exists in the List
   Test that when a `TimeEntry` object that exists in the `entries` list is passed to the `remove` method, it is successfully removed from the list.

2. Scenario: TimeEntry Object Does Not Exist in the List
   Test that when a `TimeEntry` object that does not exist in the `entries` list is passed to the `remove` method, no changes are made to the list.

3. Scenario: Null TimeEntry Object
   Test that when a null `TimeEntry` object is passed to the `remove` method, an appropriate exception is thrown or no changes are made to the list, depending on the intended behavior.

4. Scenario: List is Empty
   Test that when the `remove` method is called on an empty `entries` list, no changes are made to the list and no exceptions are thrown.

5. Scenario: Multiple Identical TimeEntry Objects in the List
   Test that when a `TimeEntry` object that appears multiple times in the `entries` list is passed to the `remove` method, only one instance of the object is removed.

6. Scenario: Concurrency
   If `entries` list is expected to be accessed by multiple threads, test that the `remove` method behaves as expected under concurrent access.

7. Scenario: Remove Method Called Multiple Times
   Test that when the `remove` method is called multiple times with the same `TimeEntry` object, the method behaves as expected and no errors occur.

8. Scenario: Remove Method Called with Different TimeEntry Objects
   Test that when the `remove` method is called with different `TimeEntry` objects, each object is correctly removed from the `entries` list. 

9. Scenario: Size of List After Removal
   Test that the size of the `entries` list is reduced by one after a successful removal operation. 

10. Scenario: State of List After Removal
    Test that the state of the `entries` list after a removal operation is as expected (i.e., all other elements remain in the correct order).
