================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Dead Code - CWE-561
Issue: The 'if (true)' statement is redundant and results in dead code. This redundancy could potentially be exploited by attackers to inject malicious code without affecting the program's operation.
Solution: Remove the 'if (true)' statement to eliminate the dead code and reduce the potential attack surface.

Vulnerability: Unchecked Delete Operation - CWE-362
Issue: The 'remove' operation is performed without any previous check if the 'entry' exists in the 'entries'. This could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
Solution: Before performing the 'remove' operation, ensure the 'entry' exists in the 'entries'.

Vulnerability: Missing Access Control - CWE-284
Issue: The 'remove' method is public, which means it can be accessed from anywhere. This could potentially be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the 'entries' data.
Solution: Change the method's access level to private or protected, or ensure proper access control is in place.

================================================================================
1. Scenario: Removing an existing entry
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called with an existing TimeEntry object, the entry is successfully removed from the list.

2. Scenario: Removing a non-existent entry
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called with a TimeEntry object that does not exist in the list, the list remains unchanged.

3. Scenario: Removing a null entry
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called with a null object, it does not throw a NullPointerException.

4. Scenario: Removing an entry from an empty list
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called on an empty list, the function does not throw an error or exception.

5. Scenario: Removing the same entry multiple times
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called multiple times with the same TimeEntry object, the function does not throw an error or exception and the list remains unchanged after the first removal.

6. Scenario: Removing entries in quick succession
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called in quick succession with different TimeEntry objects, all the specified entries are removed correctly.

7. Scenario: Removing an entry while the list is being modified
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called while another operation is modifying the list, the function behaves as expected and no data corruption occurs.

8. Scenario: Removing an entry from a large list
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called on a large list with a large number of TimeEntry objects, the function can handle the load and successfully remove the specified entry.

9. Scenario: Removing an entry from a list with duplicate entries
   Description: Validate that when the "remove" function is called on a list with duplicate TimeEntry objects, only the specified entry is removed and the duplicates remain in the list.
