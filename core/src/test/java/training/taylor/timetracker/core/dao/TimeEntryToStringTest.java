================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The toString method could potentially leak sensitive data if your `description`, `rate` or `time` contain sensitive data. This is a possibility if this toString function is used in debugging and logging activities, which could output sensitive information to the console or a log file viewable by others.
Solution: Ensure that the toString method does not disclose sensitive information or make sure that the description, rate, and time do not carry sensitive information. Alternatively, conditionally display information based on the level of logging i.e., omit sensitive data in non-debug modes.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The `toString` method directly includes the values of `description`, `rate`, and `time` without any validation or sanitization operations. If these values are configurable by an end user or take their values from an untrusted source, this may leave an application exposed to various forms of attacks, including injection attacks.
Solution: Implement validation and sanitization of input data. To mitigate this, perform necessary input validation checks and sanitize the instance variables, if necessary, before using data as part of your application logic.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to Check if the toString Method Returns Expected Result

  Details:
    TestName: validateCorrectToStringOutput.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the toString method returns the expected result. The test is focused on a regular scenario where initialised data is provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an instance of the Test class with necessary data filled in for description, rate, and time variables.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on the initialised Test class instance.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to compare the actual toString method output against the expected result.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the toString method accurately compiles the string with included variables. This establishes the proper functioning of the toString method under normal conditions.

  Scenario 2: Test to Check Behavior of the toString Method When Data Variables are Null

  Details:
    TestName: verifyToStringOutputWithNullValues.
    Description: The purpose of this test is to verify how the toString method behaves when the variables description, rate, and time are null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up an instance of the Test class with null values for description, rate, and time.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on this instance.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to compare the actual output of the toString method against the expected result, which would include the 'null' references for description, rate, and time.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the toString method accurately compiles the string even when its data variables are null, providing an understanding of its behaviour during error conditions.

  Scenario 3: Test to Check toString Method With Special Characters in Variable Values

  Details:
    TestName: checkToStringOutputForSpecialCharacterValues.
    Description: This test aims to investigate how the toString method behaves when description contains special characters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a Test class instance with special character values for the description variable and regular values for rate and time.
    Act: Invoke the toString method on this instance.
    Assert: Use a JUnit assertion to verify the actual toString method output matches the expected result which includes the special characters in the description.
  Validation:
    The purpose of this assertion is to validate the capability of the toString method to correctly compile a string even when the description includes special characters.
