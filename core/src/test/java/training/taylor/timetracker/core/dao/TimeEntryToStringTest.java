Scenario 1: Valid Input Test
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithValidInput
  Description: This test will evaluate the ability of the toString method to correctly format and return the TimeEntry string. Expected behavior is that the toString method invokes correctly and returns expected output.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class with valid description, rate, and time entries.
    Act: Invoke the toString method
    Assert: Assert that the output of the toString method matches the expected output format.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the formatting and output of the toString method works as expected with a valid input. If successful, this demonstrates that the application correctly maintains the state of a TimeEntry.
Scenario 2: Default Value Test
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithDefaultValues
  Description: This test will evaluate how the toString method reacts when no values are set for the description, rate and time - which are left as null. The expected behavior is that the tostring method should still work properly taking account the default values.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class without setting any values
    Act: Invoke the toString method
    Assert: Assert that the output of the toString method reflects the default 'null' values
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the formatting and output of the toString method works as expected with default null values. This validation is important to ensure the method and related components are robust against possible missing values.
Scenario 3: Large Input Test
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithLargeInputs
  Description: This test is designed to evaluate how the toString method will react to typically large inputs for the description, rate, and time. The exact definition of 'large' may be application-specific.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the class with unusually large values
    Act: Invoke the toString method
    Assert: Assert that the output of the toString method still correctly reflects the large input values in the formatted string.
  Validation:
    This test guarantees that the toString method can correctly handle and reflect large input values. If successful, this adds to confidence in the robustness of the application in handling edge cases.
Scenario 4: Special Characters Input Test
Details:
  TestName: testToStringWithSpecialCharacters
  Description: This test evaluates the toString method by storing special characters in the description. The expected behavior is that even with special characters, the toString method should work correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the class with special characters in the 'description' field.
    Act: Invoke the toString method
    Assert: Assert that the output of the toString method correctly includes the special characters.
  Validation:
    This test ensures the toString method correctly handles special characters if they are part of the description. If successful, this guarantees that the application can handle special characters without failure.
