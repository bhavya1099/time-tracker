================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The 'toString' method exposes all the field values. If any sensitive information such as personal or financial details are present in the 'TimeEntry' object, they can potentially be exposed in logs or error messages.
Solution: To prevent this, avoid exposing such information in the 'toString' method or in any logs. Alternatively, sanitize or obscure the sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: If the values of 'description', 'rate', or 'time' are user inputs, they may be vulnerable to injection attacks if they are not properly validated and sanitized.
Solution: Ensure that proper input validation and sanitization is implemented during the assignment of these fields.

"""
Scenario 1: Validate the Successful Execution of toString Method

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringFormat.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check if the toString method returns the correct format with the correct details. The target is a normal execution scenario.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the description, rate and time data.
    Act: The toString method is invoked for the created object.
    Assert: The returned value is compared against the expected string format.
Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify if the toString method is successfully returning the string in the correct format. It is important for this assertion to validate the correct format and values, since this will be used to present object data throughout the application.

Scenario 2: Validate the Execution of toString Method with Null Description

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithNullDescription.
    Description: This test scenario checks how the method handles a null description. The target is an error handling scenario.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the object with null description, and set the rate and time data.
    Act: The toString method is invoked for the created object.
    Assert: The returned value is compared against the expected string, with null value for description.
Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the toString method handles null description correctly, and it does not throw an error. It is significant as null values are common during real-time execution, and the application should handle such cases gracefully.

Scenario 3: Validate the Execution of toString Method with Negative Rate & Time

Details:
    TestName: validateToStringWithNegativeRateTime.
    Description: This test scenario is meant to check how the method handles negative rate and time values. The target is an error handling scenario.
Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the description, and set the negative values for rate and time.
    Act: The toString method is invoked on the created object.
    Assert: The returned value is compared against the expected string format with negative values for rate and time.
Validation:
    This assertion is aimed at verifying how the toString method handles negative values. It is crucial to validate error handling capabilities for negative inputs, as entering negative values can result in logical errors in real-world scenarios.
