  Scenario 1: Testing setRate with a positive value
  Details:
    TestName: positiveValueSetRate.
    Description: This test checks the main functionality of the setRate method. It tests the setting of a positive float value to the rate and checks if the method properly sets this positive rate.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the setRate class.
    Act: Call the setRate method with a positive float value as the parameter.
    Assert: Verify if the rate of the object is set to the positive float value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the rate has been set correctly and matches the positive value passed. The significance of this test is to ensure the main functionality of the setRate method behaves as expected.
  Scenario 2: Testing setRate with a negative value
  Details:
    TestName: negativeValueSetRate.
    Description: This test checks the functionality of the setRate method when the parameter is a negative float value. It checks whether the rate is set correctly even though the input might be invalid.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the setRate class.
    Act: Call the setRate method with a negative float value as the parameter.
    Assert: Verify if the rate of the object equals the negative value passed.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method should decline the negative input and the rate should not be set as the negative value. The significance of this test is to ensure proper error handling and validation in the setRate method.
  Scenario 3: Testing setRate with zero
  Details:
    TestName: zeroValueSetRate.
    Description: This test checks the setRate method with Zero as the parameter. It checks whether the rate is set to Zero as expected.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the setRate class.
    Act: Call the setRate method with Zero as the parameter.
    Assert: Verify if the rate of the object is set as Zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the rate has been set correctly and matches the Zero passed. The significance of this test is to ensure that the setRate method can handle the edge case of Zero as a rate.
  Scenario 4: Testing setRate with float maximum value
  Details:
    TestName: maxValueSetRate.
    Description: This test checks the functionality of setRate with the float maximum value. It checks whether the rate is set with the maximum value correctly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate the object of the setRate class.
    Act: Call the setRate method with the float maximum value.
    Assert: Verify if the rate of the object is set to maximum.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the method sets correctly when passing float maximum value. The significance of this test is to ensure that the setRate method can handle large inputs.
