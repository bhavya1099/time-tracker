"""
Scenario 1: Test to set a standard value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingStandardValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setRate method is correctly setting the value of rate to a standard float number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a float value with a standard float number.
  Act: Invoke the setRate method with the initialized float value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the new rate value with the provided float number.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the rate is accurately being set as the input value. The successful execution of this test ensures that the method is working for standard float numbers.

Scenario 2: Test to set a zero value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingZeroValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setRate method is correctly setting the value of rate when a zero-valued float is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a float value with zero.
  Act: Invoke the setRate method with the zero-valued float.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the new rate value with zero.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the rate is accurately being set as zero when the input is zero. The successful execution of this test ensures that the method is working for zero values.

Scenario 3: Test to set a negative value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingNegativeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setRate method is correctly setting the value of rate when a negative float value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a float value with a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the setRate method with the negative-valued float.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the new rate value with the negative value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the rate is accurately being set as the negative input value. The successful execution of this test ensures that the method is working for negative values.

Scenario 4: Test to set a decimal value
Details:
  TestName: testSettingDecimalValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the setRate method is correctly setting the value of rate when a decimal float value is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a float value with a decimal number.
  Act: Invoke the setRate method with the decimal float.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the new rate value with the decimal number.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that the rate is accurately being set as the decimal input value. The successful execution of this test ensures that the method is working all float values including decimal numbers.
