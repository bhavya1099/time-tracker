================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code uses import statements for both standard and third-party Java libraries, but it does not appear to include any features that ensure the integrity of these external codebases. This leaves the application potentially vulnerable to attacks involving compromised or malicious libraries.
Solution: Integrate features that verify the integrity of imported code. This can be achieved using approaches, such as cryptographic hashing techniques, to confirm that the code has not been altered since it was last trusted.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Currently, the code is assuming that all return values from 'entries.size()' are safe. If this data originates from a GET request, it may lead to the exposure of sensitive information in the URL, where it could be logged or leaked through the 'Referer' header.
Solution: Make sure that sensitive information is not passed via GET requests. If it must be passed in requests, use POST instead, since POST parameters are not typically logged or exposed as query strings are.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Issue: The method 'size' is public which could be accessed and potentially exploited by unauthorized users, as it reveals the size of 'entries', leading to accidental information disclosure.
Solution: Limit the visibility of this method as much as possible. Consider declaring it as 'private' or 'protected'. Also, consider using Java's built-in access control mechanisms for more sophisticated security needs.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing 'size' method for a list with entries

Details:
    TestName: testSizeMethodWithEntries
    Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of 'size' method in obtaining the number of elements in a 'List' where the list already has entries.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Pre-fill the 'List' with arbitrary 'TimeEntry' objects.
    Act: Call 'size' method on the 'List'.
    Assert: The return value should match the number of elements initially populated.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the 'size' method correctly counts the elements in the 'List'. This validates the operation of the 'size' method when list has entries.

Scenario 2: Testing 'size' method for an empty list

Details:
    TestName: testSizeMethodWithEmptyList
    Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of 'size' method in obtaining the number of elements in a 'List' where the list is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not add any entries to the 'List'.
    Act: Call 'size' method on the 'List'.
    Assert: The return value should be zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the 'size' method correctly recognizes an empty 'List'. This validates the operation of the 'size' method when list is empty.

Scenario 3: Testing 'size' method after adding an entry to the list

Details:
    TestName: testSizeMethodAfterAddingElement
    Description: This test aims to validate that the 'size' method reflects the currently accurate count of entries in a 'List' after an entry has been added.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initially the list is empty, add a new 'TimeEntry' object to the list.
    Act: Call 'size' method on the 'List'.
    Assert: The return value should be one.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks whether the 'size' method accurately updates when a new entry is added to the list. This validates the operation of the 'size' method after adding an element to list.
