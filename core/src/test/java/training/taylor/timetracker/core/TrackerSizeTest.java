"""
  Scenario 1: Test for Zero Size
  Details:
    TestName: testSizeWhenNoEntries
    Description: This test checks if the size method correctly returns zero when no entries have been added to the 'entries' list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No entries are added to the 'entries' list.
    Act: Invoke the size() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size is zero.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the size method correctly identifies an empty list and returns the size as zero. This is important to ensure accurate tracking of time entries.
  Scenario 2: Test for One Entry
  Details:
    TestName: testSizeWithOneEntry
    Description: This test verifies if the size method correctly return one when one entry has been added to the 'entries' list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add one entry to the 'entries' list.
    Act: Invoke the size() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size is one.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the size method correctly identifies the presence of one entry in the list. This is significant to accurately track the time entries.
  Scenario 3: Multiple Entries
  Details:
    TestName: testSizeWithMultipleEntries
    Description: This test will verify if the size method can successfully return the correct count of multiple entries added to the 'entries' list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add multiple entries to the 'entries' list.
    Act: Invoke the size() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size matches the number of entries added to the list.
  Validation:
    The assertion confirms that the size method can successfully count multiple entries in the list. This test is crucial for ensuring accurate tracking of multiple time entries.
  Scenario 4: Removal of Entries
  Details:
    TestName: testSizeAfterRemoval
    Description: This test is meant to verify if the size method updates the count correctly after an entry has been removed from the 'entries' list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Add multiple entries to the 'entries' list. Remove one or more entries.
    Act: Invoke the size() method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size is equal to the number of remaining entries in the list after removal.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the size method keeps track of removed entries and correctly updates the count. This contributes to precise tracking of time entries, considering possible removals.
