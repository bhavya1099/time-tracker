================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: This can occur in the application if it downloads code without sufficient checks on the integrity and authenticity of the code. This can allow remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
Solution: Always add integrity checks, like checksums or digital signatures, before using downloaded code. Always download over secure channels like HTTPS.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code contains debugging information that could expose sensitive information to an attacker. Debugging code can give an attacker misuse cases in the system.
Solution: Remove all debug code or logging statements that expose sensitive data before going into the production environment. Logs should not contain sensitive information and debugging logic should be separated from application logic.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Issue: The code lacks necessary checks and validation mechanisms to ensure the data it processes is safe, allowing potential attacks such as buffer overflows, command injections or memory corruption if not handled correctly.
Solution: Always validate input and sanitize output. Implement proper exception handling and error checking. Use a safe API for tasks such as string manipulation and memory management.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Reliance on Untrusted Inputs in a Security Decision
Issue: The software makes security decisions based on the results of operations on untrusted inputs, which can cause it to make incorrect security decisions that lead to further vulnerabilities.
Solution: The software must use trusted inputs. It should validate inputs before invoking business logic or making security-relevant decisions.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing successful size retrieval

Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfulSizeRetrieval
    Description: Checking if the method correctly gets the size of the 'entries'.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an entries object with a known number of items.
    Act: Call the 'size' method on the entries object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size matches the expected number of items.
Validation:
    This test validates that the size method correctly determines the size of the entries object. Should this method fail, it would mean that there's an issue with how the number of entries is accounted for.

Scenario 2: Testing size retrieval on an empty list

Details:
    TestName: testSizeOnEmptyList
    Description: Verifying that the method returns zero when 'entries' are empty.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty entries object.
    Act: Invoke the 'size' method on the entries object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned size is zero.
Validation:
    This test checks the handling of empty 'entries'. A successful test would ensure that the method correctly identifies when no TimeEntries have been logged.

Scenario 3: Testing the size method after adding new objects

Details:
    TestName: testSizeAfterAddition
    Description: Verify if the size method appropriately updates after adding new entries.
Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate an entries object, note down its size, and add a few more entries.
    Act: Call the 'size' method on the entries object.
    Assert: Assert that the new size is the original size plus the number of added entries.
Validation:
    This test case ensures that the 'size' method dynamically updates upon adding new entries. This is vital for accurately keeping track of the number of logged TimeEntries.

Scenario 4: Testing the size method after removing objects

Details:
    TestName: testSizeAfterRemoval
    Description: Check if the size method correctly updates after removing entries.
Execution:
    Arrange: Create an entries object with certain items, note down its size, and remove a few entries.
    Act: Invoke the 'size' method on the entries object.
    Assert: Assert that the new size is the original size minus the number of removed entries.
Validation:
    This test verifies that the 'size' method accurately reflects the count of remaining entries after some have been deleted. It's critical for maintaining the integrity of the TimeEntry log.
