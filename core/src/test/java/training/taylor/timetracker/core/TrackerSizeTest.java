================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Missing Control of Java Class Loading (CWE-497)
Issue: Java uses ClassLoaders to dynamically load classes into a Java application at runtime. An attacker could manipulate the class loading process to execute malicious code.
Solution: Ensure your code does not show any behavior which allows an attacker to control the ClassLoader instances. More Info: https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/497.html

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (CWE-639)
Issue: Java applications can easily expose internal objects. If not properly managed, an attacker can manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.
Solution: Make sure all objects are adequately protected before they are referenced. This could mean implementing authorization controls and/or redacting the confidential details.

Vulnerability: Improperly Validating Input (CWE-20)
Issue: Java applications can be susceptible to many different types of attacks if they are not properly validating input. This could result in data corruption, security violation, crash, etc.
Solution: Implement strong input validation methods such as strong typing, server-side validation, and strict exception handling

Vulnerability: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (CWE-937)
Issue: The Java application uses a component (e.g., library, module) with known vulnerabilities, which can allow these exploits to be used against the application.
Solution: Check for known vulnerabilities in the components used by the application regularly and update them as necessary.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Validating return of size from an empty list

Details:
  TestName: testSizeOfEmptyList
  Description: This test case is meant to check the size functionality by passing an empty time entries list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of TimeEntry.
  Act: Invoke the size method without adding any items to the list.
  Assert: Assert that the size of the empty list is 0.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method properly works on an empty list and returns 0. It validates the behavior of the function when the list is empty, which is a crucial corner case.

Scenario 2: Validating return of size when the list has items

Details:
  TestName: testSizeWithItemsInList
  Description: This test case is meant to check the size functionality by using a populated list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of TimeEntry and add some random items.
  Act: Invoke the size method after adding items to the list.
  Assert: Assert that the size of the list matches the number of items added.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the size method returns the correct size even when the list has elements. This is an important scenario as it's the intended behavior of the method.

Scenario 3: Validating return of size when items are added and then removed

Details:
  TestName: testSizeAfterAddingAndRemovingItems
  Description: This test case is meant to check the size functionality by adding and then removing items from the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of TimeEntry, add some random items, and then remove one or some of them.
  Act: Invoke the size method after the above operation.
  Assert: Assert that the size of the list reflects the current number of items.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the size method properly accounts for items being removed from the list. This checks the dynamic nature of the list and how well the method keeps up with these changes.
