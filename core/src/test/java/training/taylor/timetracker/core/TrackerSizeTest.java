================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The code might be exposed to vulnerabilities related to information exposure due to the use of the size() method. The size of 'entries' data structure is returned, but there are no any information about where this data comes from. If it is coming from an untrusted source, as as user input, it might lead to information leakage.
Solution: Ensure that any information returned from 'entries' data structure are properly validated, sanitized, and encoded to prevent exposure.

Vulnerability: CWE-318: Cleartext Storage in-memory
Issue: The data stored in the 'entries' data structure is stored in plaintext. If sensitive data is stored in this way, it is vulnerable to memory dumping or access by other processes. The ease in extracting this data from volatile memory might pose a significant security risk.
Solution: Ensure proper encryption even when data is stored in-memory. Java provides various libraries for in-memory encryption that can be implemented easily. Follow the Java encryptions guidelines (Java Cryptography Architecture (JCA) and Java Secure Socket Extension (JSSE)) which specify how to encrypt Java in-memory data.

Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: There's no mechanism to control or monitor the lifetime of the 'entries' data structure. This might lead to resource exhaustion, which can be leveraged by an attacker to carry out Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
Solution: Implement proper resource handling procedures to monitor the state and manage the life time of the 'entries' object. This could include closing or releasing the resource after use, or implementing limits to resources to guard against resource exhaustion.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test for Valid Size of Entries

Details:
  TestName: testSizeOfValidEntries
  Description: This test verifies the correct size or count of entries return when there are valid entries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a list with a known number of TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Invoke the size method on the list.
  Assert: The resultant size should be equal to the number of TimeEntry objects added.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies the successful retrieval of the size of entries. If the method returns the correct count, it validates that the size method is functioning as expected.

Scenario 2: Test for Empty List Size

Details:
  TestName: testEmptyListSize
  Description: This test checks if the size method returns 0 when there are no entries.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up an empty TimeEntry list.
  Act: Invoke the size method on the empty list.
  Assert: The resultant size should be 0.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the size method accurately handles empty TimeEntry lists. An accurate return of 0 suggests that the method correctly identifies when a list contains no elements.

Scenario 3: Test for Null List

Details:
  TestName: testNullList
  Description: This test is designed to check the function's behavior when null is used instead of a list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Assign null to the list.
  Act: Invoke the size method.
  Assert: The method should throw a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that a NullPointerException is thrown when invoking the size method on a null list, thereby validating correct error handling.

Scenario 4: Test for List Size After Adding an Entry

Details:
  TestName: testListSizeAfterAddingEntry
  Description: This test verifies if the size method is updated after an entry is added to the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a list with a certain number of TimeEntry objects, then add another entry.
  Act: Invoke the size method on the list.
  Assert: The size should have increased by 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the size of the list is correctly updated after an entry is added. This means the size method is reacting correctly to changes in the list. 

Scenario 5: Test for List Size After Removing an Entry

Details:
  TestName: testListSizeAfterRemovingEntry
  Description: This test verifies if the size method is updated after an entry is removed from the list.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a list with a certain number of TimeEntry objects, then remove an entry.
  Act: Invoke the size method on the list.
  Assert: The size should have decreased by 1.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the size of the list is correctly updated after an entry is removed. This shows the size method adequately reflects changes in the list.
