"""
Scenario 1: Testing successful time setting
Details:
  TestName: testSuccessfulTimeSetting.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the time value is set correctly without any errors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Have an instance of the object and a time value ready.
  Act: Invoke the setTime method with the prepared time value.
  Assert: Assert that the time value stored in the object is equal to the set value.
Validation:
  This ensures that the time value is correctly set as expected, validating the correct functionality of the setTime method.
Scenario 2: Testing time setting with negative value
Details:
  TestName: testNegativeTimeSetting.
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when setting a negative time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Have an instance of the object and a negative time value ready.
  Act: Invoke the setTime method with the prepared negative time value.
  Assert: Assert that the time value stored in the object is not negative.
Validation:
  This test is important as it checks the method's robustness against negative input values. In reality, time values should not be negative, and the method should handle this case appropriately.
Scenario 3: Testing time setting with excessively large value
Details:
  TestName: testLargeInputTimeSetting.
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when setting a very large time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Have an instance of the object and a very large time value ready.
  Act: Invoke the setTime method with the large time value.
  Assert: Assert that the time value stored in the object is not unreasonably large.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's ability to handle abnormally large input values. This is important as it ensures that the method can handle any value within the integer range.
Scenario 4: Testing time setting with zero value
Details:
  TestName: testZeroTimeSetting.
  Description: This test is meant to check the method's behavior when setting a zero time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Have an instance of the object and a zero time value ready.
  Act: Invoke the setTime method with the zero time value.
  Assert: Assert that the time value stored in the object is zero.
Validation:
  This test explores the method's behavior by setting a time value of zero. This checks the method's correctness and adherence to the business rules.
