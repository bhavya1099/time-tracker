"""
Scenario 1: Testing for a valid index within the bounds of the entries list.
Details:
  TestName: validateGetWithValidIndex
  Description: This test is meant to check the get method functionality when given a valid index. The target scenario is when the entries list, a private member variable of type List<TimeEntry>, is not null or empty, and an index within the bounds of the entries list is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate/populate the entries list with some TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Invoke the get method with a valid index.
  Assert: Verify that the TimeEntry object returned is the same as the one at the specified index in the entries list.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify that the get method correctly retrieves the TimeEntry object at the specified index from the entries list. The expected result is that the correct item is retrieved, which is important for maintaining data integrity and consistency within the application.
Scenario 2: Testing for an invalid index outside the bounds of the entries list.
Details:
  TestName: validateGetWithInvalidIndex
  Description: The test is meant to validate the method's functionality when handling an invalid index. The target scenario is when the entries list is not empty, but the given index is out of the list's bounds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Populate the entries list with TimeEntry objects.
  Act: Call the get method with an index that is outside the entries list's bounds.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  The objective here is to prove that the function appropriately handles an index Out of Bounds exception. This is significant as it is a potential error point during runtime and the application should be robust enough to handle such situations accordingly.
Scenario 3: Testing when the entries list is null
Details:
  TestName: validateGetWithNullEntriesList
  Description: This test is meant to check the get method functionality when the entries list is null. The target scenario is when the entries list is null but the get method is invoked.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the entries list to null.
  Act: Invoke the get method with any index.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
  This test aims to verify that the get method correctly handles a null entries list, preventing a NullPointerException from being thrown directly and thus avoid crashing the application.
