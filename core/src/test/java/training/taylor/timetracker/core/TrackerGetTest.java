================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Empty Try-Catch Blocks (CWE-390)
Issue: The try-catch block in the get() function is empty, and thus any exceptions that may occur within the block cannot be caught and handled appropriately.
Solution: Ensure that you catch specific exceptions and handle them properly. Always avoid catching generic exceptions.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)
Issue: The get() function directly retrieves time entries based on the index. This can lead to unauthorized access if index values are controllable by user input.
Solution: Implement a mechanism to validate or map the ownership of the object to the requesting user to prevent unauthorized access. Avoid direct references to internal implementation objects.

Vulnerability: Incorrect Equality Comparison (CWE-595)
Issue: The comparison valid = true is an assignment, not a comparison. It will always return true as it sets valid to true.
Solution: Use the comparison operator (==) instead of the assignment operator (=) for correct conditional checks.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test the get() method for valid input
  Details:
    TestName: testGetWithValidInput
    Description: This test checks if the get method returns the correct TimeEntry object for a valid index inputted by the user.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the test by creating and storing multiple TimeEntry objects within this class.
    Act: Invoke the get method using a valid index within the range of the stored TimeEntry objects.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the returned TimeEntry object matches the object at the given index position.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the get method accurately retrieves and returns the TimeEntry object from the specified index. This is vital as it tests the primary functionality of the get method.

  Scenario 2: Test the get() method for an invalid index
  Details:
    TestName: testGetWithInvalidIndex
    Description: This test verifies the get method's behavior when given an invalid index that is out of the range of stored TimeEntry objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the test by creating and storing multiple TimeEntry objects within this class.
    Act: Invoke the get method using an invalid index that's out of range.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
  Validation:
    This scenario checks if the get method correctly handles edge cases where the provided index is invalid. In these scenarios, the method should throw an exception, trying to protect the application from breaking because of accidental or malicious invalid inputs.

  Scenario 3: Test the get() method when no TimeEntry objects are stored
  Details:
    TestName: testGetWithNoStoredObjects
    Description: This test checks the get method's behavior when no TimeEntry objects have been stored.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the test with no TimeEntry objects stored.
    Act: Invoke the get method using any index.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the method throws an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
  Validation:
    This scenario checks if the get method can smartly handle instances where it is triggered even though no TimeEntry objects have been stored yet. In these scenarios, the method should throw an exception, protecting the application from potential errors due to premature object retrieval calls.
