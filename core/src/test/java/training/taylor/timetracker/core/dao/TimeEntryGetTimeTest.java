================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: The getTime() method is public which means it can be accessed from anywhere. Without proper validation and access control, it might lead to information exposure.
Solution: Make sure to implement proper access control and validation to prevent undesired information exposure. Consider using private visibility for sensitive methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Unused Imports
Issue: The code imports two packages which are not used anywhere in the provided code. Unused imports increase the application's attack surface and slow down application load time.
Solution: Remove unused imports and only import necessary packages.

Vulnerability: CWE-561: Dead Code
Issue: The getTime() method contains no code. It only consists of a function signature. Dead code can make the application harder to maintain and obscurate issues.
Solution: Remove functions, procedures, or blocks that will never be processed.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Default Time Value Test

Details:
  TestName: testDefaultTimeValue
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the getTime() method returns the default time value when initially called.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup is required as we're testing the initial state of the time value.
  Act: Invoke the getTime() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned time value is equal to the default time value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies that getTime() method accurately returns the time's default value.
  It ensures that the getTime() function is correctly initialized and ready for subsequent application behavior or business logic.

Scenario 2: Updated Time Value Test

Details:
  TestName: testUpdatedTimeValue
  Description: This test aims to check whether the getTime() method correctly returns a modified time value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the time value to a specific number.
  Act: Invoke the getTime() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned time value is equal to the set time value.
Validation:
  This assertion verifies if the getTime() accurately reflects changes to the time value.
  It validates the getTime() function's reliability under normal operational conditions.

Scenario 3: Negative Time Value Test

Details:
  TestName: testNegativeTimeValue
  Description: This test aims to check how the getTime() method handles negative time values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the time value to a negative number.
  Act: Invoke the getTime() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned time value is equal to zero or the absolute value of the set time.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to confirm how the application handles incorrect or unsuitable time values.
  It tests the robustness and error handling capabilities of the getTime() function.

Scenario 4: Overflow Time Value Test

Details:
  TestName: testOverflowTimeValue
  Description: This test aims to ascertain how the getTime() method handles time values that exceed the maximum limit for an integer.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the time value to a number greater than the maximum limit for an integer.
  Act: Invoke the getTime() method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the returned time value is equal to the maximum integer value.
Validation:
  This assertion aims to verify the boundaries and overflow prevention mechanisms of the getTime() function.
  It evaluates the resilience and behavior of the getTime() function under extreme conditions or potential system-level constraints.
