Scenario 1: Validate if timeEntries method returns an empty list.
Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturningEmptyList
  Description: This test validates that the timeEntries method returns a blank array list for TimeEntry as it is expected to not hold any preexisting data.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as we are validating on the method instantiation.
  Act: Call the method timeEntries().
  Assert: Assert that the output of timeEntries is an empty list.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the accurate behaviour of method instantiation resulting in an empty list. This is expected as the method is supposed to return a new empty list every time it is called.
Scenario 2: Validate if timeEntries method returns a list of type TimeEntry.
Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnType
  Description: This test checks if the returned list from the method timeEntries is of type TimeEntry. This is necessary to ensure the list adheres to the defined data type.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement needed as default state of the method suits the test scenario.
  Act: Invoke the method timeEntries().
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is an instance of List<TimeEntry>.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the returned object is of the type List<TimeEntry>. This check ensures that data type integrity is maintained.
Scenario 3: Validate if modifying the returned list does not affect the results of subsequent method calls.
Details:
  TestName: testTimeEntriesListIsolation
  Description: This test scenario is to verify that adding or removing elements in the list that's returned by the method does not affect the next call to the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Add some elements to the list returned by the first call to timeEntries.
  Act: Call the method timeEntries() again.
  Assert: Assert that the list returned by the second call is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion affirms that subsequent calls to the function are not affected by any actions performed on previously returned lists. This is important because the timeEntries function, being a factory method, should always return a brand new list.
