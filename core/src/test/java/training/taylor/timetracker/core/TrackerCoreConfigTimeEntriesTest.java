================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References or CWE-639
Issue: If the TimeEntry objects contain sensitive information and their references are exposed, it may lead to unauthorized data access.
Solution: Implement access controls checks or use indexes in the array rather than the direct references of the objects.

Vulnerability: Improper Neutralization or CWE-93
Issue: In case of adding data related methods dealing with external input, That might lead to code injection attacks.
Solution: Validate, sanitize and encode external inputs and outputs. Use prepared statements with variable binding in case of using a database operations.

Vulnerability: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release CWE-404
Issue: If objects in the list hold onto system resources like files or connections and these aren't released properly, it may exhaust system resources.
Solution: Ensure proper shutdown or release of resources when they are no longer needed, possibly using try-with-resources construct.

Vulnerability: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type CWE-434
Issue: If there are methods to serialize this List into a file or deserialize from a file and file uploads/downloads are not restricted, it may lead to malicious file upload/download.
Solution: Ensure to restrict and check file types during upload/download operations. Avoid serialization and deserialization as much as possible and if required use safe alternate APIs.

"""
Scenario 1: Test the timeEntries method when no time entries are present
  Details:  
    TestName: testTimeEntriesForEmptyResult.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the timeEntries method returns an empty list when there are no time entries present in the system. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is necessary for this scenario since the system doesn't have any time entries.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list is empty.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the timeEntries method accurately provides an empty list when there are no time entries. Expected result is based on the intended functionality of the method. The significance of this test is to ensure that the functionality behaves correctly under empty conditions.

Scenario 2: Test the timeEntries method when there are multiple time entries present
  Details:  
    TestName: testTimeEntriesForMultipleEntries.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the timeEntries method returns a list with all time entries when there are multiple entries present in the system.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create several time entries in the system.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned list contains all the time entries created in the Arrange step.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the timeEntries method accurately provides a list of all time entries when they are present. Expected result is based on the intended functionality of the method. The significance of this test is to ensure that the functionality behaves correctly under populated conditions.

Scenario 3: Test the timeEntries method for return type
  Details:  
    TestName: testTimeEntriesForReturnType.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the timeEntries method returns a list of TimeEntry objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement is necessary for this scenario.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned object is a list of TimeEntry objects.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify the returned object's type. The expected result is based on the method signature which specifies a list of TimeEntry objects as the return type. The significance of this test is to ensure that the method's return type conforms to its definition.
