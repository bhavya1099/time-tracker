================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unnecessary Code and Dependencies - CWE-116
Issue: The included libraries are not being actually used in the presented piece of code, which can potentially pose a vulnerability if these libraries have inherent security flaws. Unused code creates opportunities for unauthorized code execution and increases the attack surface.
Solution: Remove unused imports and dependencies from your code. This reduction makes the code cleaner, easier to read and potentially reduces the attack surface.

Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) - CWE-639
Issue: The `TimeEntry` method seems to be returning a new `ArrayList` which may contain sensitive data. Poor access controls might lead to exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized users.
Solution: Implement proper access control checks and also employ data abstraction where necessary. Always try to limit the scope of data that is being presented to the user.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Check Return Type

  Details:
    TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnType.
    Description: This test checks that the method returns an instance of a list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data, mocks, or test doubles need to be set up for this test.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries() method.
    Assert: Assert that the return value is an instance of ArrayList.
  Validation:
    This test ensures that the timeEntries() method returns an instance of a list, which is necessary for its proper functionality. The significance lies in verifying the accurate type of the return object.

  Scenario 2: Check Returned List Is Empty

  Details:
    TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnsEmptyList.
    Description: This test checks that the method returns an empty list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to set up any data, mocks, or test doubles in this test.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
  Validation:
    This verifies that the list returned by the timeEntries method that is called initially is empty, which ensures the logic of the method is correctly implemented to initialize an empty list.


  Scenario 3: Check List Modifiability

  Details:
    TestName: testTimeEntriesReturnedModifiable.
    Description: This test checks if the list returned by the method is not a fixed size array, but a modifiable ArrayList.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No data, mocks, or test doubles to setup in this test.
    Act: Invoke the timeEntries method and try changing the returned list (adding an element).
    Assert: Assert no exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    As the method is expected to return a new ArrayList, it would mean that the list should be modifiable. This can be a crucial aspect for scenarios where the list may need to be modified in the future after being returned by the method.
