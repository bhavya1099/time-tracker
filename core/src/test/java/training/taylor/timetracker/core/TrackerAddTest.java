================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)
Issue: The method add in the class doesn't contain any control mechanism to limit the number of TimeEntry objects that can be inserted, potentially leading to excessive use of resources (like memory). This vulnerability can lead to denial of service attacks (DoS).
Solution: Implement control mechanisms to limit the number of TimeEntry objects that can be added, thus avoiding resource exhaustion. You could use a max-entries per session/timeout system, for example.

Vulnerability: Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)
Issue: The method add doesn't check what's being inserted into the entries collection. If an unchecked, malicious TimeEntry object is added it could lead to unexpected behavior or crashes, and may be a potential injection point.
Solution: Before adding the entry to the collection, validate the object to ensure it meets your criteria for a safe and expected entry. Implement a standard Input Validation routine before processing new entries.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test to verify the addition of a new TimeEntry

  Details:
    TestName: testAddNewTimeEntry.
    Description: This test is meant to check if a new TimeEntry is successfully added to the 'entries' list. It also checks if the size of the 'entries' list is incremented by one afterwards.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new instance of TimeEntry.
    Act: Invoke the add method with the new TimeEntry as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the size of the 'entries' list increased by one and the last entry of this list is the TimeEntry created before.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that a new TimeEntry is successfully added at the end of the list, and the size of the list is appropriately increased. This is important to ensure that the add method is functioning as expected and maintaining list order.

  Scenario 2: Test to verify handling of null TimeEntry addition

  Details:
    TestName: testNullTimeEntryAddition
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the add method when a null TimeEntry is passed as argument. This confirms the resiliency of the code against null value inputs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the parameter of the add method as null.
    Act: Invoke the add method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the add method throws a NullPointerException when a null TimeEntry is attempted to be added. This is important as it prevents possible null de-reference errors which could crash the application.

  Scenario 3: Test to verify the addition of multiple TimeEntries

  Details:
    TestName: testAddMultipleTimeEntries.
    Description: This test is meant to check if multiple TimeEntries are successfully added to the 'entries' list. It also checks if the size of the 'entries' list is incremented accordingly.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create several instances of TimeEntry.
    Act: Invoke the add method multiple times, each with a different TimeEntry as parameter.
    Assert: Assert that the size of the 'entries' list increased by the number of TimeEntries added and the entries are added to the list in the correct order.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that multiple TimeEntries are successfully added to the list, and the size of the list is appropriately increased. This ensures that the add method is working correctly with multiple inputs and maintaining the correct order of the list.
