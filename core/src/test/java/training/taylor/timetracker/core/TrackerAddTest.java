"""
Scenario 1: Successful Addition of a TimeEntry Object

Details:  
  TestName: testAddTimeEntry.
  Description: This test ensures that adding an object of the type TimeEntry to the existing list of entries works as expected. 

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object.
  Act: Invoke add() with the previously created TimeEntry object. 
  Assert: Check that the last element in the entries list matches the entry object added. 

Validation:
  The assertion would validate that the add operation added our new TimeEntry object succesfully to the list. This functionality is crucial as it's the basis of tracking time in the application.
  
Scenario 2: Addition of null object

Details:  
  TestName: testAddNullTimeEntry.
  Description: This scenario tests the method's ability to handle a null object as its argument.

Execution:
  Arrange: No object creation is necessary here.
  Act: Invoke add() method with null value.
  Assert: Check if a NullPointerException has been thrown.

Validation: 
  This scenario validates the method's handling of a null parameter. Expecting it to throw a NullPointerException because adding a null entry is not beneficial to the application and is likely unintended by the user.
  
Scenario 3: Repeated Addition of Same TimeEntry Object

Details:
  TestName: testMultipleAdditionOfSameTimeEntry.
  Description: This scenario tests if the method works as expected when the same TimeEntry object is added multiple times.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object.
  Act: Invoke add() multiple times with the previously created TimeEntry object.
  Assert: Verify that the size of the entries list gets larger by the number of times add() was called with the same object.

Validation:
  This test aims to validate if the system is allowing the same TimeEntry object to be added repetitively. This might be necessary in scenarios wherein the same time entry needs to be recorded multiple times for a reason. The validation of this test primarily revolves around maintaining the integrity of the list size.
