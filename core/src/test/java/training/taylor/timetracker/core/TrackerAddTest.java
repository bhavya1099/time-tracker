================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-494: Download of Code Without Integrity Check
Issue: The code imports libraries from third-party sources without checking its integrity. These libraries potentially could contain malicious code that can compromise the application's security.
Solution: Always ensure the integrity of third-party sources before using their code. Use official repositories for package management, verify the checksums and secure the download channels.

Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: In the add() function, the input TimeEntry entry is directly used without any validation check. This opens up potential vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the input data is coming from untrusted sources.
Solution: Ensure data validation and sanitization for any inputs to your methods, especially when the inputs are coming from untrusted sources. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate SQL Injection and apply appropriate output encoding when rendering inputs.

Vulnerability: CWE-265: Privilege Over-assertion
Issue: The add() method could potentially modify the entries list, raising possible integrity issues. If the method is being executed with more privileges than necessary, it could lead to unauthorized access or modification of data.
Solution: Apply the Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) while designing your applications. Each module or user in the system should only have the minimum set of privileges necessary to perform its function.

"""
Scenario 1: Test add method with a valid entry.

  Details:
    TestName: testAddWithValidEntry.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the `add` method correctly adds a valid `TimeEntry` to the list of entries.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for `TimeEntry`.
    Act: Invoke `add` method with the mock `TimeEntry`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the `TimeEntry` has been added to the list.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the list size has increased by 1. A successful test indicates correct functionality of the add method.

Scenario 2: Test add method with a null entry.

  Details:
    TestName: testAddWithNullEntry.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the `add` method handles null `TimeEntry` correctly without throwing any exceptions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific arrangement.
    Act: Invoke `add` method with null `TimeEntry`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the list size has not changed.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the list size remains the same. A successful test indicates that the `add` method can handle null values correctly.


Scenario 3: Test add method with multiple entries.

  Details:
    TestName: testAddWithMultipleEntries.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the `add` method correctly adds multiple `TimeEntry`s to the list of entries.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create multiple mocks for `TimeEntry`.
    Act: Invoke `add` method with each mock `TimeEntry`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that all `TimeEntry`s have been added to the list.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the list size has increased by the number of added `TimeEntry`s. A successful test indicates that the `add` method functions correctly with multiple entries.

Scenario 4: Test add method when list is full.

  Details:
    TestName: testAddWhenListIsFull.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the `add` method correctly handles the scenario when the list of entries is full.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Manually fill the list with mock `TimeEntry`s.
    Act: Invoke `add` method with another mock `TimeEntry`.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that no exceptions are thrown and proper method behavior is exhibited.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that no Exception is thrown. If the List implementation is ArrayList or LinkedList, it should resize itself, therefore no exception should be thrown.
