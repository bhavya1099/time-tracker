Scenario 1: Successfully add a TimeEntry

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEntrySuccessfully
  Description: This test aims to validate the successful addition of a TimeEntry object to the entries list. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new TimeEntry object.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the created TimeEntry object as a parameter.
  Assert: Verify that the size of the entries list increased by one after the operation.
Validation: 
  This asserts that the add method correctly adds a new TimeEntry to the list, thus validating the functionality. Successful completion of this test is significant as it would ensure that the basic functionality of the method performs as expected.

Scenario 2: Adding a null TimeEntry 

Details:  
  TestName: testAddNullEntry
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of add method when null is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is needed since we are passing null.
  Act: Invoke the add method with null as the parameter.
  Assert: Assert the size of entries remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  This asserts that passing a null object to the add method does not affect the list size, thereby validating the method's ability to handle null inputs. If such inputs are not appropriately handled, it may lead to NullPointerExceptions, affecting the stability of the application.

Scenario 3: Adding a duplicate TimeEntry 

Details:  
  TestName: testAddDuplicateEntry 
  Description: This test will check the behaviour of add method when a duplicate TimeEntry is passed as a parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object and add it to the entries.
  Act: Invoke the add method with the existing TimeEntry object.
  Assert: Assert that the size of entries list increased, indicating duplicates are allowed. If duplicates are not allowed, list size should remain the same.
Validation: 
  This test validates whether the 'add' method can handle the addition of duplicate TimeEntry objects effectively. It's an important piece of functionality that must work correctly since the business might either allow or restrict duplicate entries based on its requirements.
