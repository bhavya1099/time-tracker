================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Direct Object References
Issue: The function getRate() directly exposes a field, possibly leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
Solution: Encapsulate fields with accessor and mutator methods providing necessary validation and access control.

Vulnerability: CWE-693: Protection Mechanism Failure
Issue: The class does not implement any form of access control, allowing anyone to access and potentially modify sensitive data.
Solution: Implement role-based access control or any other appropriate access control mechanism.

Vulnerability: Missing Input Validation
Issue: The function getRate() does not perform any input validation, potentially causing unhandled exceptions or unanticipated behavior.
Solution: Verify and sanitize inputs to avoid application crashes or unintended behavior.

Vulnerability: CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
Issue: Without appropriate exception handling, stack traces could expose sensitive system or application information.
Solution: Use a try-catch block to handle exceptions effectively and prevent information exposure.

"""

  Scenario 1: Testing to ensure the getRate method returns the expected rate value.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetRateReturnValue.
    Description: This test is designed to verify whether the getRate method returns the expected value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed in this case, as getRate method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Call the getRate method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned rate is as expected.
  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the getRate method is functioning as per expectation and returning the correct rate. The rate return value plays a critical role in our application's calculations.


  Scenario 2: Testing for unexpected values returned by getRate method.

  Details:
    TestName: testGetRateForUnexpectedValues.
    Description: The goal of this test is to verify the behavior of the getRate method when it returns unexpected values (Non-negative, NaN, null).
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed in this case, as getRate method does not take any parameters. But configure the conditions to return unexpected values.
    Act: Invoke the getRate method.
    Assert: Assert that an appropriate exception or error is thrown for unexpected return value.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to verify that the getRate method appropriately handles and reports scenarios where it fails to return an appropriate and expected value. It is critical to identify these scenarios to ensure application reliability and accurate calculations.


  Scenario 3: Testing getRate method within concurrent scenarios.

  Details:
    TestName: testConcurrentGetRateCalls.
    Description: This test is designed to validate the behavior of the getRate method when it is called concurrently by multiple threads.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Advance arrangement is not required for this case as getRate method does not take any parameters.
    Act: Start several threads that call the getRate method simultaneously.
    Assert: Assert that each thread receives the expected rate value from the getRate method in a thread-safe manner.
  Validation:
    The assertion intends to check the method's thread-safety for possible concurrent execution. This is notable because in real-world application scenarios multiple clients or services may call the getRate method concurrently.
