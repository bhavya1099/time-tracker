================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: The method getRate() is public, potentially exposing sensitive information. If 'rate' holds sensitive data, making this variable freely accesible may have security implications.
Solution: Consider changing the method's access level or adding authentication/authorization checks to it.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: The use of public in the method getRate() implies that it's accessible from anywhere, which can lead to misuse if the method allows alteration or disclosure of sensitive data.
Solution: Ensure that methods are given the most restrictive access level possible. If the method needs to be exposed, safeguard it with proper input validation and error handling.

Vulnerability: Insecure Dependency Import
Issue: The import statements import org.springframework.context.annotation.Scope; and import org.springframework.stereotype.Component; might lead to insecure use if their versions are outdated or have known security vulnerabilities.
Solution: Always use the latest library version. Regularly check and update the versions of dependencies your code is using.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Test if the getRate method return the correct rate

Details:  
  TestName: testReturnValueOfGetRate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getRate method returns the correct value of the rate of the underlying object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object and set the rate to a known value.
  Act: Invoke the getRate method.
  Assert: Compare the returned value with the known value set in the arrange step.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getRate method returns the correct value by comparing it to a preset known value. This test is significant in validating the object's state reflection through the getRate method.

Scenario 2: Test if the getRate method handle the case when the rate is not set

Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultValueOfGetRate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getRate method returns the default value when the rate is not explicitly set for the object. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object without setting the rate.
  Act: Invoke the getRate method.
  Assert: Check that the returned value is 0.0f, which is the default value of the floating variable in java.
Validation: 
  This assertion aims to verify that the getRate method returns the default value (0.0f) when rate was not set. This test is important as it can help detect uninitialized object states and reflects the safe handling of these cases.

Scenario 3: Test if the getRate method returns the rate after it has been changed

Details:  
  TestName: testGetRateAfterChange.
  Description: This test is meant to check if changes to the rate variable are reflected when the getRate method is called. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock object and set the rate to a known value. Then change the rate to another value.
  Act: Invoke the getRate method.
  Assert: Check that the value returned is the last value set.
Validation: 
  This test aims to verify that the getRate method always returns the current value even after it changes. It is important in validating the dynamic reflection of the object state through the getRate method.
