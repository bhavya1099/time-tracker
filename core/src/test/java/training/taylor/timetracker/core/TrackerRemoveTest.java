================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-691: Insufficient Control Flow Management
Issue: There is an unnecessary 'if (true)' statement, which is always true and can cause confusion or lead to faulty logic in larger code bases. This isn't a security risk per se, but it's a poor coding practice that can lead to vulnerabilities.
Solution: Remove the redundant 'if (true)' check to improve the clarity and quality of your code.

Vulnerability: Object mutable by untrusted data (CWE-20: Improper Input Validation)
Issue: The 'entry' object is directly removed from 'entries' without any validation check. This can potentially introduce bugs if the 'entry' object does not exist in 'entries'.
Solution: Check if 'entries' collection contains 'entry' before removing it.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: Null Pointer Dereference
Issue: If 'entries' is null when the method is called, it would cause a NullPointerException at runtime.
Solution: Ensure 'entries' is not null before calling remove method on it. One way to handle it can be by using Optional in Java.

"""  
Scenario 1: Test successful removal of TimeEntry

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulRemovalOfTimeEntry
  Description: This test is meant to check if the TimeEntry object is successfully removed from the entries collection when the remove method is invoked. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object and add it to the entries collection. 
  Act: Invoke the remove method with the created TimeEntry object as the parameter. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify the entries collection no longer contains the TimeEntry object.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the TimeEntry object is removed from the entries collection. This validates that the remove method performs as expected in removing a TimeEntry object from the collection. 

Scenario 2: Test removing a TimeEntry object that is not in the entries collection

Details:  
  TestName: testRemoveNonExistentTimeEntry
  Description: This test is meant to check the behaviour of the remove method when it is invoked with a TimeEntry object that does not exist in the entries collection. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object but do not add it to the entries collection.
  Act: Invoke the remove method with the created TimeEntry object as the parameter. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the entries collection remains unchanged.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the entries collection stays the same after an attempt to remove a non-existent TimeEntry object. This validates that the remove method does not affect the entries collection when it fails to find the provided TimeEntry object.

Scenario 3: Test remove method with null parameter

Details:  
  TestName: testRemoveNullTimeEntry
  Description: This test is meant to check the behaviour of the remove method when it is invoked with a null parameter. 
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required since the parameter to be passed is null.
  Act: invoke the remove method with null as the parameter. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the removal of null does not affect the entries collection.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the entries collection does not change after an attempt to remove null. This validates the remove method's behavior when passing null, ensuring that it does not cause unwanted side-effects.
