================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unconditional Statement (CWE-670)
Issue: There is an 'if (true)' statement in the code, which will always return true. This makes the second 'entries.remove(entry);' call redundant and can lead to unnecessary computation and potential logic errors.
Solution: Remove the 'if (true)' statement and evaluate conditions based on dynamic logic or actual boolean values, not static ones.

Vulnerability: Potential Null Pointer Exception (CWE-476)
Issue: The code does not check if 'entries' or 'entry' is null before calling the 'remove' method. If either of these objects is 'null', this will throw a NullPointerException which can cause the program to crash.
Solution: Before calling the 'remove' method on the 'entries', check if 'entries' and 'entry' are not null. Only then, proceed to the 'remove' method.

Vulnerability: Exposed Internal Object (CWE-495)
Issue: The 'entry' object appears to be passed directly into this method, which means that changes made inside this method will reflect in the original 'entry' object, leading to potential mutable object vulnerabilities.
Solution: To mitigate this, try returning a clone of the object, or using the copy constructor, so any modification to it doesn't affect the original object.

"""
  Scenario 1: TimeEntry Successful Removal Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testTimeEntrySuccessfulRemove.
    Description: This test checks if the 'remove' function properly removes a TimeEntry object from the 'entries' collection.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object and add it to the 'entries' collection. 
    Act: Invoke the 'remove' method with the created TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Assert that the size of the entries collection is zero after removal.
  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the 'remove' operation is successful and the entries collection no longer contains the TimeEntry instance. This tests the primary functionality of the 'remove' method.
    
  Scenario 2: TimeEntry Removal Non-existent Entry Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testTimeEntryRemoveNonExistent.
    Description: This test verifies whether the 'remove' function appropriately handles the scenario when an attempt is made to remove a non-existent TimeEntry from the 'entries' collection.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object but do not add it to the 'entries' collection. 
    Act: Invoke the 'remove' method with the created TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Assert that the size of the entries collection remains unchanged.
  Validation: 
    The assertion confirms that the 'remove' operation does not affect the size of the 'entries' collection when a non-existent TimeEntry instance is passed to it. This test ensures that the method correctly handles edge cases and maintains data integrity.

  Scenario 3: Null TimeEntry Removal Test
  Details:  
    TestName: testNullTimeEntryRemoval.
    Description: This test is meant to verify the behavior of the 'remove' method when a null value is provided as a parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not create a TimeEntry object. 
    Act: Invoke the 'remove' method with null as a parameter.
    Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion justifies that trying to remove a null TimeEntry instance from the collection should lead to an exception. This is important to test as it verifies the method's resiliency against incorrect input parameters and potential null pointer exceptions.
