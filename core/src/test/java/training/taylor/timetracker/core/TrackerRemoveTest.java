================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unconditional control flow CWE-670
Issue: In the remove(TimeEntry entry) method, the 'if (true)' condition always holds, causing an entry to potentially be removed twice. This could lead to unexpected program behavior.
Solution: Restructure the control flow to ensure entries are removed as intended. Remove 'if (true)' or replace it with an appropriate logical condition.

Vulnerability: Unused imports CWE-563
Issue: There are several imports in the beginning of the code that are not being used. Unused imports lead to dead code, decrease clarity, and can potentially cause security issues, as unused libraries present an additional attack surface.
Solution: Remove all unnecessary imports to keep the code clean and improve security by reducing the attack surface.

Vulnerability: Missing error handling CWE-391
Issue: If the 'entries.remove(entry)' operation fails (e.g., if the entry doesn't exist in the list), there is no error handling present to catch and deal with this scenario.
Solution: Wrap the 'entries.remove(entry)' calls in a try-catch block, or check whether the entry exists in the list before attempting to remove it.

================================================================================
"""
  Scenario 1: Test remove method with valid TimeEntry
  Details:
    TestName: testRemoveWithValidTimeEntry
    Description: Test to ensure the removal of a valid TimeEntry object from the entries list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a valid TimeEntry object and add it to the entries.
    Act: Invoke the remove method with the created TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the entries list no longer contains the TimeEntry object.
  Validation:
    This test aims to ensure that the given TimeEntry object can be successfully removed from the entries list.
    It is significant in confirming the basic functionality of the removal from the list.

  Scenario 2: Test remove method with null TimeEntry
  Details:
    TestName: testRemoveWithNullTimeEntry
    Description: Test to check the behaviour of the remove method when null is as argument.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No need to arrange any data as null is passed as parameter.
    Act: Invoke the remove method with null.
    Assert: Expect an exception, and use JUnit assertions to check if the exception is thrown.
  Validation:
    This test aims to verify the error handling capability of the remove method. If null is passed as an argument, it should handle it properly.

  Scenario 3: Test remove method when TimeEntry is not in the list
  Details:
    TestName: testRemoveWithNotExistingTimeEntry
    Description: Test to check behaviour of remove method when a non-existing TimeEntry object is passed.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a TimeEntry object but do not add it to the 'entries' list.
    Act: Invoke remove method with this object as parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the 'entries' list remains unchanged.
  Validation:
    This test verifies that the remove method effectively handles the situation when the TimeEntry object passed as an argument does not exist in the 'entries' list.
