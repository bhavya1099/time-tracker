================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-480: Use of Incorrect Operator
Issue: The 'if (true)' statement is always true, and as such, the following line of code 'entries.remove(entry);' will always be executed. This could lead to unintended handling such as removing entries that should not be removed.
Solution: Use a proper conditional statement instead of 'if (true)' to ensure the remove operation is executed appropriately.

Vulnerability: CWE-470: Unrestricted File Upload
Issue: Without proper checks, the code might potentially remove system files or other sensitive data when handling path traversal issues, if the 'entry' parameter of the 'remove' function can be controlled by an attacker.
Solution: Sanitize the 'entry' parameter to the 'remove' function. Ensure that it does not refer to file paths or system resources that the user should not have access to.

Vulnerability: CWE-664: Improper Control of a Resource Through its Lifetime
Issue: The 'entries' object is manipulated without sufficient checks. If the entries object is not initialized or null, this will result in a NullPointerException.
Solution: Implement a check to ensure 'entries' object is not null before calling 'remove' method.

Vulnerability: CWE-276: Incorrect Default Permissions
Issue: Public methods and data can be accessed by any code which has a reference to the object, not just the methods that are part of the object's logical interface. This could lead to inadvertent leaks of state information.
Solution: Identify and apply the minimum privileges needed for each method/function. Use Java's built-in features for controlling access (private, protected, public).

"""
  Scenario 1: Successful removal of a TimeEntry from entries list

  Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfulTimeEntryRemoval
    Description: The test is meant to check if the provided TimeEntry object is successfully removed from the entries list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object and add it to the entries list.
    Act: Invoke the remove method by passing the newly created TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm the TimeEntry object has been removed from the entries list.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the TimeEntry object has been removed effectively from the entries list. This test is significant to assure the basic functionality of the remove function.

  Scenario 2: Removal of a non-existent TimeEntry from entries list

  Details:
    TestName: testRemovalOfNonExistentTimeEntry
    Description: The test is meant to check if no exception is thrown when trying to remove a non-existent TimeEntry from the list of entries.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object, but don't add it to the entries list.
    Act: Invoke the remove method by passing the newly created TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that no exception is being thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the remove method can accept a non-existing entry in the list and still pass successfully without throwing an exception.

  Scenario 3: Removal of a null TimeEntry from entries list

  Details:
    TestName: testRemovalOfNullTimeEntry
    Description: The test is meant to check if no exception is thrown when attempting to remove a null TimeEntry from the list of entries.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Do not create any TimeEntry object as null is being passed.
    Act: Invoke the remove method by passing a null value.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that no exception is being thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the remove method can accept a null value and not throw an exception, this might be useful in scenarios where we get effete values.

  Scenario 4: Successful removal of a TimeEntry twice from entries list

  Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfulTimeEntryRemovalTwice
    Description: The test is meant to check if no exception is thrown when attempting to remove the same TimeEntry twice from the entries list.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a new TimeEntry object and add it to the entries list.
    Act: Invoke the remove method twice by passing the same TimeEntry object.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that no exception is being thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the remove method is still working effectively even when the same TimeEntry object is being removed twice. This is useful to confirm the idempotence of the method.
