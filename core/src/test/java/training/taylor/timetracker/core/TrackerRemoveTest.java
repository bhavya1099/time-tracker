"""
Scenario 1: Test with a valid TimeEntry in the list
Details:
  TestName: testRemoveValidTimeEntryFromList
  Description: This test checks that an existing TimeEntry in the list is successfully removed when the remove function is called.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of TimeEntries and include a specific TimeEntry to be removed.
  Act: Invoke the remove method with the specific TimeEntry as the parameter.
  Assert: Check the list of TimeEntries to ensure the specific TimeEntry is not found.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the specific TimeEntry was successfully removed from the list. This is based on the functionality of the remove method, which should successfully remove a TimeEntry from the list when called with a valid TimeEntry as the argument.
Scenario 2: Test with an invalid TimeEntry not in the list
Details:
  TestName: testRemoveInvalidTimeEntryFromList
  Description: This test checks the method response when trying to remove a TimeEntry that does not exist within the entries list.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of TimeEntries excluding the specific TimeEntry to be removed.
  Act: Invoke the remove method with the specific TimeEntry as the parameter.
  Assert: Check the list of TimeEntries to ensure it remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion in this scenario aims to confirm that the method does not make changes to the list if a non-existing TimeEntry is provided. This is important since it ensures that the method only operates on entities within its collection.
Scenario 3: Test executing the remove method on an empty list
Details:
  TestName: testRemoveTimeEntryFromEmptyList
  Description: This test validates the method's behavior when the remove method is invoked on an empty entries list.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty list of TimeEntries.
  Act: Invoke the remove method with a specific TimeEntry as the parameter.
  Assert: Check the list of TimeEntries to ensure it still remains empty.
Validation:
  The assertion checks that the entries list remains unchanged, confirming the method's expected behavior when a removal operation is performed on an empty collection.
Scenario 4: Test with a null TimeEntry
Details:
  TestName: testRemoveNullTimeEntryFromList
  Description: This test verifies the behavior of the remove method when a null TimeEntry is provided as parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a list of TimeEntries.
  Act: Invoke the remove method with a null TimeEntry as the parameter.
  Assert: Check for exception or ensure the list remains unchanged.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that providing a null TimeEntry does not affect the list, confirming the robustness of the remove method to handle invalid inputs.
